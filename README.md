# Neural Networks
Machine Learning training project utilising [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to build a deep neural network model and make predictions.

#### Project status - Complete

## Introduction

The intention of this project was to build a functioning neural network using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), experiment with hidden layers and nodes and see the effect of other hyperparameters in the model.

This was based on examples used in the excellent [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) offered by Google.



### Methods used
* EDA
* Machine Learning
* Deep Neural Networks
* Loss Function Plotting
* Gradient Descent
* Activation Functions
* Feature Engineering
* Data visualisation

### Technologies used
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

### Data sources
[California Housing Dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/california-housing-data-description) based on the 1990 US Census. The data is at the 'block' level, so each record contains data for multiple houses or apartments.

This is a familiar dataset for Machine Learning training, so apologies for the lack of originality! 

Sourced from [Google](https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/california_housing_train.csv).


### Getting started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is kept in the CSV files in the [data](https://github.com/thecraigd/Deep_Neural_Net_with_TensorFlow/tree/master/data) folder of this repo.
3. All code is contained within the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thecraigd/Deep_Neural_Net_with_TensorFlow/blob/master/Neural_Nets.ipynb) for this project, stored in the root folder as Neural_Nets.ipynb
